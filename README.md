# SpringBoard-AI-Moodmate-Aug-2025
MoodMate is an AI-powered system that detects a user’s emotional state from either facial expressions or text input and recommends music that aligns with or enhances their mood. It combines computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation system techniques to deliver a personalized and interactive experience.

# MoodMate: Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Description

MoodMate is an AI-powered system that detects a user’s emotional state from either facial expressions or text input and recommends music that aligns with or enhances their mood. It combines computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation system techniques to deliver a personalized and interactive experience.

### 🔑 Key Features

* Emotion detection from images (CNN-based) or text (BERT/LSTM).
* Music recommendation engine using content-based filtering (cosine similarity, TF-IDF).
* Real-time user interface for mood-based playlist suggestions.
* Integration of emotion classification with music datasets.

### 📂 Datasets

* **FER-2013** (facial emotion recognition)
* **Million Song Dataset / Last.fm Dataset** (music metadata, tags, genres, moods)
* **RAVDESS** (optional – multimodal speech & song emotion dataset)

### 🎯 Outcomes

* Understand emotion detection from images/text.
* Build a recommendation engine using emotion–music mapping.
* Deliver a functional prototype with real-time suggestions.
